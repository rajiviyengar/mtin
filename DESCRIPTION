Description: General package for fitting cluster weighted models using the Multivariate Tail Inflated Normal (MTIN) distribution introduced by \insertCite{punzo2021}{mtin}. The MTIN belongs to the family
     of elliptical distributions and is characterized by mean vector \eqn{\boldsymbol{\mu}}, scale matrix \eqn{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}, and inflation parameter \eqn{\theta \in (0,1)}. It can also be represented as a
     normal scale mixture with the uniform distribution as the mixing distribution. The use of the MTIN allows for robust parameter estimation in the presence of mild outliers. \insertCite{punzo2021}{mtin}
     This package allows for ordinary model-based clustering with conditional mean imputation implemented for missing values. Cluster-weighted regression modeling is implemented, though imputation is only 
     possible for the response variable. Parameter estimation is achieved by implementation of the ECME algorithm.
